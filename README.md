# Spotify_Python with Pandas

In this project I have download " Spotify-2023 " dataset from Kaggle.com. With Git's source control feature I have created and uploaded my working.

I have found that The Weeknd - Blinding Lights has the most streamed number with 	3703895074.

I have explained every step that I have implemented to reach the most streamed song.
